# SIT102 - Introduction to Programming (C++)

This repository contains programming assignments and exercises completed for the SIT102 unit at Deakin University. All projects are written in C++ using the SplashKit framework.

## About

These projects demonstrate fundamental programming concepts learned throughout the semester, including:
- User input/output
- Control flow and loops
- Functions and procedures
- Data structures (arrays, vectors, structs)
- Graphics and animation
- Sound effects
- Input validation

## Projects

### Week 1-8 Projects
Weekly exercises covering basic concepts and progressively building programming skills.

### HelloUser_2.2
- User input handling
- Air speed velocity calculations using the Strouhal number
- Custom functions for string and numeric input

### CircleMoving
Interactive graphics program featuring:
- Moveable circle controlled with arrow keys
- Color changing with keyboard input
- Boundary detection to keep the circle on screen

### ControlFlow
Menu-driven program demonstrating:
- Switch statements and loops
- Custom message display based on user names
- Number guessing game (1-100)
- Air speed calculations
- Multiplication operations

### Scene
Animation program that:
- Loads and displays bitmap images
- Plays sound effects
- Creates timed visual sequences

### StructEnum
Demonstrates data structures with:
- Custom `knight_data` struct (name, age, quest, weapon)
- Enum for update options
- Interactive CRUD operations for knight records

### Working_With_Arrays
Array manipulation exercises including:
- Name collection and storage
- String length calculations
- Finding shortest name
- Array searching and indexing

### Working_With_Vectors
Vector operations featuring:
- Dynamic name collection
- User input until sentinel value ("X")
- Vector manipulation (push/pop operations)

### ValidateUserInput
Input validation library with:
- Custom header file implementation
- Range-validated integer input
- Double precision range validation
- Boolean input parsing

### CustomHeader
Demonstrates creating and using custom header files for code organization.

### Test/Practice/TryShit
Experimental and testing projects for trying out new concepts.
